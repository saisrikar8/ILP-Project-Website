                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Esperanza Cordero, a twelve year old Chicana (Mexican-American) girl, moves to a house that is on Mango Street. It is an upgrade from the apartment her family had lived in before, but she still does not like it. It is small and crowded. On her street is a poor, Latino community in the city of Chicago.

            <h2>Family & Friends</h2>
            <p>
                Esperanza's family is composed of many different characters. In the beginning of the book, Esperanza describes her family.
                In the vignette &#x201c;Hairs&#x201d;, for example, Esperanza describes her family members' hair, which reflected their personalities.
                All of Esperanza's descriptions paints a clear picture of her family members. Kiki and Carlos, Esperanza's brothers, try to be
                masculine. They also don't like being around Esperanza and Nenny outside of home. At home, they are forced to be with their sisters.
                Also, Esperanza's brothers treat each other like friends, which Esperanza envies. Nenny, Esperanza's little sister, stays around Esperanza a lot. 
                Since Nenny is a lot younger than Esperanza, Esperanza thinks that Nenny is a babysitting responsibility rather than a friend.
                Esperanza's father is a man who wants Esperanza to act womanly and wants to marry her off to make her leave home. She doesn't really like his ideals, though.
                Finally, Esperanza feels safe around her mother. It seems that she likes her mother the most in her family. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Esperanza meets a lot of people in her community and makes a few friends as well. In the beginning of the book, Esperanza 
                wants a friend who she can talk to and trust. As mentioned before, Esperanza envies Kiki and Carlos because they have each other
                as friends. Unfortunately, Esperanza's sister is a lot younger than Esperanza, so Esperanza views Nenny as a babysitting responsibility.
                In fact, she describes herself as a balloon stuck to an anchor while all the other balloons(other people) can fly freely. In other words, Esperanza
                feels like she is stuck with Nenny. Nenny is the anchor that is pulling Esperanza down. Then, Esperanza split the cost of a bike with two other girls(and Nenny)
                and became friends with these girls. Their names were Rachel and Lucy. Rachel, Lucy, Esperanza, and Nenny would always be together. Esperanza had finally found herself some friends.

        <div class = "women">
            <h2>Woman Role Models</h2>
            <p>
                In this book, Esperana is constantly searching for a woman role model. Some examples are her mom, Sally, and Alicia. 
                A lot of these women go through a lot of hardships. Sally, Esperanza's classmate, wants to gain freedom. One time, Sally got
                beaten up so badly that she couldn't come to school for two days. Sally tries to find freedom, so she eventually marries
                a salesman to escape. Unfortunately, the salesman locks Sally in his house. She says that she likes the big house, but
                she is just trying to hide the fact that she didn't get what she wanted: freedom. Another example, is Alicia from the vignette
                &#x201c;Alicia Who Sees Mice&#x201d;. Alicia's mother died, so Alicia, the oldest sibling, was forced to do all the chores at home like cooking and taking care of her younger siblings.
                Alicia doesn't want to do this for the rest of her life, so she decided to get an education to escape from doing all of this.
                She wakes up every morning and uses public transportation to go to college. The common thing between these two scenarios is that
                both Alicia and Sally tried to escape and get freedom from what society expects them to do as women. Alicia's path is through education while
                Sally took the rash decision of running away and marrying a salesman.

        <div class = "poverty">
            <h2>Poverty</h2>
            <p>
                Esperanza's family and everyone in their community is in poverty. Esperanza is always embarrassed about her small house. Children in 
                Esperanza's neighborhood are not expected to go to college because their parents don't have enough money for it. This causes the cycle of poverty.
                However, this inspired Esperanza to leave Mango Street and get an education. She wants to get a house of her own and help people without homes
                by letting them live in her attic. Once she is successful, she wants to come back to Mango Street and stop the cycle of poverty in her community
                on Mango Street.

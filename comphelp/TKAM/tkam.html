                <p>Jean Louise &#x201c;Scout&#x201d; Finch is an outspoken tomboy living in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's. While growing up, she begins to see the world around her in a new way alongside her brother Jem and her friend Dill. She notices racism as well as sexism in her community and what kinds of expectations society has on certain groups of people.</p>

            <h2>Development and Growth</h2>
            <p>
                This book emphasizes Scout and Jem's childhood. It shows how much they grow and meet new people in their community.
                In the first chapter itself, Scout and Jem meet Charles Baker &#x201c;Dill&#x201d; Harris, who becomes really good 
                friends with them. In the beginning of the book, Scout and Jem had do stay within calling distance of Calpurnia, so
                really close to their house. Then, Scout goes to school and meets a lot of people like Walter Cunningham. Later in 
                the book, Scout, Jem, and Dill explore the Radley Place and meet Miss Maudie Atkinson. Then, they meet Mrs. Dubose 
                and Jem has to read to her for a while. Eventually, they walked to downtown Maycomb routinely. It seemed that they
                went to new places, which resembled how much they grew and met new people.

            <h2>The Great Depression</h2>
            <p>
                This book is during the Great Depression, so a lot of people are in poverty. During the Great Depression, farmers could not get much 
                money. Since none of the farmers in Maycomb have enough money, there aren't many people who pay the doctors and lawyers in Maycomb.
                Basically, no one had money. Scout grew up in this disaster, but did not have to witness much of it since her family did not have any
                farmers.

        <div class = "beforethetrial">
            <h2>Before the Trial: Effects on Scout and Jem</h2>
            <p>
                When Atticus decides to defend a Black man in a case, many people in Scout's community shows a lot of hate towards Atticus.
                In fact, she beat up Cecil Jacobs because he wouldn't stop calling Atticus insulting names. Then, Scout's relative, Francis,
                called Atticus some really bad things, so Scout beat him up. Unfortunately, Francis lied to the rest of the Finches and made
                it look like Scout beat him up for no reason. One more example is when Mrs. Dubose insulted Atticus and Jem destroyed her yard 
                with Scout's baton. This shows how much racism there is in Maycomb. In fact, this book is set in a time when there was a lot of 
                racism and Jim Crow laws were in place in the South.

        <div class = "thetrial">
            <h2>The Trial</h2>
            <p>
                The trial is probably the best part of this book. A Black man named Tom Robinson was accused of assaulting a woman named Mayella
                Ewell. First, Heck Tate is questioned. He testifies that Mayella was all beaten up on the ground and that she should washed her face
                with a bucket of water. Then, Bob Ewell, Mayella's father, testifies that he saw Tom assaulting Mayella. Then, Mayella testified that 
                Tom grabs her by the neck and cusses at her. On the other hand, Tom testified that Mayella grabbed him by the legs and he ran away when
                he saw Mr. Ewell coming. Unfortunately, the verdict still comes out as guilty because of the racial prejudice among the jury.
